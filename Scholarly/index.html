      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
		As we all know, these days, the video games are gainning more and more popularity. Back in the day, people had to go in the shops
          in order to buy the video game that they wanted. That means they had to wait for the game to be in the shop, to see if that certain game is in stock
          and so on.
		That's why the GaMa website is useful, by using it people can buy their game instantly, receiving a virtual copy of it, without waiting.
